# Preface

The book introduces readers to writing **programming code** at a beginner's level (basic coding skills), working  the **development environment** (IDE), using **variables** and data, **operators** and **expressions**, working with the **console** (reading input data and printing output), usage of **conditional statements** (**`if`**, **`if-else`**, **`if-elif-else`**), **loops** (**`for`**, **`while`**) and working with **functions** (declaring and calling functions, passing parameters, and returning values). The book uses **Python** programming language and **PyCharm** development environment. The covered training material provides basic preparation for a deeper study of programming.

The book is also used as an unofficial **textbook for school-level programming courses in the high schools**, studying professions like "**Programmer**", "**Application Programmer**" and "**System Programmer**".

## Who is This Book Intended for?

This book is suitable for **complete beginners in programming**, who want to find out what programming is and learn the main constructions for writing programming code that is used in software development. The book provides a **solid basis** of practical skills that are used for further study in programming and software development.

## Why Did We Choose The Python Language?

For this book, we chose **Python**, because it is a **modern** language for high-level programming and at the same time it is easy to learn and suitable for **beginners**. As a use **Python** is **widespread**, with a well-developed ecosystem, numerous libraries, and technological frameworks, and therefore gives many **prospects** for development. **Python** combines the paradigms of procedural, functional, and object-oriented programming in a modern way with easy-to-use syntax. In the book, we'll use the **Python language** and the **PyCharm** development environment, which is available for free from JetBrains.

As we will explain more about later, the programming language you start with does not make a significant difference in the process of learning to code, but you still need to choose one. For this book, we will focus specifically on Java. You can find the principles and concepts explained here illustrated with other programming languages like C#, JavaScript, and Python [here](https://softuni.org/learn/resources/free-programming-books?utm_source=FreeProgrammingBooks&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=PythonBook).

## The Book in Other Programming Languages: Java, JavaScript, C#, C++

This programming book for complete beginners is available in several programming languages (or is in the process of being adapted for them):

If you prefer a different language, choose from the list above.

## Programming is Learned by a Lot of Writing, Not Reading!

If anyone thinks they're going to read a book and learn to program without writing a code and solve tasks hard, they're delusional. Programming is learned with **many, many practices**, with writing code every day and solving hundreds, even thousands of tasks, seriously and with perseverance, for years.

You need to **solve a lot of problems**, to make mistakes, to fix them, search for solutions and information on the Internet, to try, to experiment, to find better solutions, get used to the code, syntax, programming language, development environment, error search and debugging of non-working code, task reasoning, algorithmic thinking, breaking down problems in steps and implementing every step, gaining experience and improving your skills every day, because learning to write code is just **the first step towards the profession of a software engineer**. You have a lot to learn!

We advise the reader, as a minimum, **to try all the examples from the book**, to interact with them, to change and test them. Even more important than the examples **are the exercises** because they develop the practical skills of a developer.

**Solve all the tasks in the book**, because programming is learned by practice! The tasks after each topic are carefully selected to cover in-depth the included learning
material. The purpose of solving all tasks from all the topics covered is to give **complete writing skills to a program code** at the beginners level (as is the purpose of this book).
