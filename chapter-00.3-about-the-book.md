# The History Behind This Book

The main engine and project manager for the creation of the current **free programming book for beginners** with open source is **[Svetlin Nakov, PhD](https://nakov.com)**.

In 2014, the SoftUni initiative was launched. In the beginning, it had a wider reach and included more theory, but in 2016 Svetlin Nakov, PhD completely revised them, renovated, simplified, and **directed them to be more practical**. This is how the **learning content core of this book was created**.

SoftUni's free programming start-up trainings are probably the largest ever conducted in Bulgaria. On the principle of free software and free knowledge, Svetlin Nakov led a **team of volunteers** and started this open-source project, initially to create a book based on programming with the C# language and later with other programming languages.
